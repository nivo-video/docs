{/* ## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys that must be provided by using the `Authorization` header. 

You can get your API key from the Nivo dashboard inside account settings.

```json
"headers": {
  "Authorization": "<your-api-key>"
}
```
