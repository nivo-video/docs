## Introduction

Webhooks are used to receive events from Nivo. You can use webhooks to receive events like when a video is uploaded, a transcription is created, etc.

All webhooks are sent using HTTP `POST` requests.

### Example payload

Below you can check an example payload for a `upload.created` webhook event.

```json Example payload
{
  "trigger": "upload.created",
  "payload": {
    "id": "23a8e2ba-ca40-4ed0-ab0a-fe0847c1fbf5",
    "title": "Sample video",
    "description": null,
    "duration": 286,
    "collectionId": "81a8d44e-930d-460c-a178-55d571810833",
    "folderId": null,
    "externalId": null,
    "streamUrl": null,
    "tags": ["courses", "tutorials"],
    "metadata": {
      "custom_platform_id": "8B710CBD-47B0-48DA-8CF1-629797572FF8"
    }
  }
}
```

## Signature verification

All webhooks are signed using a HTTP header called `Nivo-Signature`. This header contains a JWT that is signed using the secret key present in the webhook list inside Nivo dashboard.

```json Example HTTP headers
{
  "Nivo-Signature": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmNDgzZTgzNi1mMzRlLTQ1NjgtYjBhOS0zN2VkOWVlNGNiMjYiLCJleHAiOjE3MzYyNzY3NjIsImlzcyI6Im5pdm8iLCJzdWIiOiJodHRwczovL2JhZC1hbGxpZ2F0b3ItNDQud2ViaG9vay5jb29sIn0.t4Auv7rKjEmN-4oXQb4kuWIV2uN0wo8b0S2-nWb6S0Q"
}
```

## Retries

Webhooks are retried 3 times with an exponential backoff. After 3 retries, the webhook is considered failed and will not be retried again.
